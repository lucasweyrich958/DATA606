## Part 1 - Introduction
Currently, the aviation industry is in a crisis. Several incidents, on the ground and in the air have occured in the last few year. Whether those are issues with air traffic control and tower--near misses between planes on the ground, or technical issues in the air that led to an increased number of emergency landings. 

Especially in 2024, Boeing has gotten quite a bit of scrutiny, as many aircrafts involved in the in-air incidents are Boeing-built. So much so that the insitution responsible for air safety in the US started an investigation, and top Boeing executives resign. With the aviation industry being clearly a duopoly, Boeing and Airbus, several voices on social media and news outlets have voiced to avoid Boeing-built planes. This even has caused some flight prices to spike, such that airlines that primarily fly airbus, such as Lufthansa, are now significantly more expensive for transatlantic flights than airlines that fly more Boeing planes, like KLM or Delta. 

But is Boeing really involved in more incidents than Airbus is, or is the media again subject to the availability bias, as it is the case so often? Using a dataset described more below, this project aims to answer this question. While airline crashes are still amazingly and extremely rare, it is still an interesting question. Even though Boeing exists for much longer than Airbus, I hypothesize that Boeing has been involved in more crashes per year than Airbus has, since year 1971 (Airbus was founded in 1970). 

In order to answer this question I will be conducting a Chi-Square test comparing the number of incidents between Boeing and Airbus. Additionally, a two-samples t-test will be used to compare the average crashes per year for each aircraft manufacturer. Below, several indicators and summary statistics about the dataset are discussed.

## Part 2 - Data
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle, which was ultimately pulled by a service called "Open Data" and is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abeperez/historical-plane-crash-data.

The dataset is significantly cleaned, as seen below, in order to filter for only Boeing and Airbus planes, to exclude any military operations, and to include only incidents after 01/01/1971 (as mentioned above, Airbus was founded in 1970, including earlier dates would skew the data). Additionally a new dataframe was computed in which the years were grouped and then the occurences of Boeing and Airbus counted for the time comparison. Both final data frames are shown below.

```{r}
df = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lucasweyrich958/DATA606/main/Plane%20Crashes.csv")
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)

df$Date = as.Date(df$Date)

planes = df %>%
  filter(grepl("Airbus|Boeing", Aircraft)) %>%
  filter(Date > 1970-01-01)

planes = planes %>%
  mutate(manufacturer = ifelse(grepl("Boeing", Aircraft), "Boeing",
                               ifelse(grepl("Airbus", Aircraft), "Airbus", NA)))
  
planes$year = format(as.Date(planes$Date), "%Y")

final_data = planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n())

final_data_year = planes %>%
  group_by(year, manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = manufacturer, values_from = count, values_fill = 0)

head(final_data)
head(final_data_year)
```
## Part 3 - Exploratory data analysis
### Chi-Square Test

For the Chi-Square test, the assumptions require that the data are absolut counts, not percentages or ratios, as well as the counts to be mututally exclusive. Both of these assumptions are met. Below is a bar plot to show the count of incidents by manufacturer overall.
```{r}
ggplot(final_data, aes(x = manufacturer, y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#EFBC9B", color = "black", width = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Incidents by Manufacturer", x = "Manufacturer", y = "Number of Incidents") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Comparison Over Time
To compare the number of incidients over time, the data was summarised over years. This allows to visualize the data over time with a time-series (see below), and also compare the data using a two-samples t-test as a distribution can be computed, each year being an observation. For this, the assumptions are that the data is normally distributed, which is met for the Boeing counts, but not for the Airbus counts (see histogram below). 
However, given that the counts of incidents is a discrete variable, with 0 being an important number, it is forgivable.
Lastly, the boxplot suggests already that there may be a greater average incident count per year with Boeing than with Airbus.
```{r}
summary(final_data_year)

final_data_year$time = as.Date(paste0(final_data_year$year, "-01-01"))
final_data_long <- final_data_year %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(Boeing, Airbus),
               names_to = "Manufacturer",
               values_to = "Count")

ggplot(final_data_year, aes(x = time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Boeing, color = "Boeing")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Airbus, color = "Airbus")) +
  labs(title = "Incidents by Manufacturer Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Incidents",
       color = NULL) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Boeing" = "#D37676", "Airbus" = "#76885B"),
                     labels = c("Airbus", "Boeing")) +
  theme_minimal()

ggplot(final_data_year) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Airbus), fill = "#76885B", alpha = 0.7, bins = 20, color = "black") +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = Boeing), fill = "#D37676", alpha = 0.7, bins = 20, color = "black")

ggplot(final_data_long, aes(x = Manufacturer, y = Count, fill = Manufacturer)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Incidents by Manufacturer (year averages)",
       x = "Manufacturer",
       y = "Number of Incidents") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Boeing" = "#D37676", "Airbus" = "#76885B")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 12),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        legend.title = element_blank(),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12))

final_data_year$time = as.Date(paste0(final_data_year$year, "-01-01"))
```


## Part 4 - Inference
### Chi-Square Test
In order to perform the Chi-Square test of independence, the data has to be pivoted to long format, so that there is a column for both manufacturers. Following that, the test can be performed. In the tests below, the alpha is 0.05

For the Chi-Square test, the null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference between the counts of incidients by aircraft manufacturer, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) states that there is a significant association between the manufacturer of aircrafts and the frequency of incidents. In other words, the distribution of incidents is not independent of the type of aircraft.

```{r}
final_data_pivot = final_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = manufacturer, values_from = count)
chisq.test(final_data_pivot)
```
The test shows a Chi-Squared value of 333.37 with a p-value below 0.05, rejecting H0. This suggests that there is a significant association between aircraft manufacturer and incidients frequency.

## Two-Samples t-Test
In order to consider this over time, a two-samples t-test is performed on the data that is grouped by year. Here, the null hypothesis (H0) suggests that there is no significant difference in the mean counts of incidents, over the years from 1971 - 2022, between aircraft manufacturer. The alternative hypothesis, however, states that there is a significant difference.

```{r}
t.test(final_data_year$Boeing, final_data_year$Airbus, var.equal = T)
```

The two-samples t-test shows a t-value of 14.23, a p-value below 0.05 and  95% CI bounds of 8.14 - 10.80. Since the p-value is below 0.05, and the 95% bounds do not include the null hypothesis (in this case the number 0), the null hypothesis may be rejected. This suggests that there is in fact a statistically significant difference in the mean numbers of incidents per year between Boeing and Airbus.


## Part 5 - Conclusion
In this project, I investigated whether there was in fact a significant difference in the number of incidents between the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and Airbus since 1971. To investigate this, two hypothesis tests were utilized, the Chi-Square test of independence to compare absolute counts, as well as the two-sample t-test to compare means grouped by year. Both tests rejected the null hypothesis by exhibiting p-values below 0.05, which suggests that there is in fact a statistically significant difference between number of incidents between commercial flights with Boeing and Airbus aircraft. Specifically, it appears that Boeing has more incidents than Airbus, both absolut from 1971 - 2022, and on average for each year. This furthermore suggests that the voices heard from the media to rather Boeing planes are SOMEWHAT warranted. 

However, the media is not fully vindicated, as there are several caveats with this project. Firstly, relative occurrence of ANY incident occurring during commercial flights is extremely low: 3.42 accidents per ONE MILLION departures (ICAO, 2024). Therefore, even though it does appear Boeing's internal leadership and quality control issues are real, it is by no means less safe to board a Boeing plane over an Airbus plane. Additionally, as can be inferred from the time-series graph above, incidents in the air for Boeing planes have decreased over time, compared to the late 20th century.
Lastly, the variable in this project consisted of incident observations. Incidents are defined by the ICAO (2019) as "An occurrence, associated with. the operation of an aircraft which affects or could affect. the safety of operation." Therefore, it important to remember that an incident may also be something minor that still allowed the plane to safely arrive at its planned destination.

Concluding, this project assessed aircraft incidents between Boeing and Airbus. While the results suggest that there are more Boeing incidients than Airbus incidents, the results have to be taken with many caveats.
